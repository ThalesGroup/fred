    Base class for LangGraph-based AI agents.

    Each agent is a stateful flow that uses a LangGraph to reason and produce outputs.
    Subclasses must define their graph (StateGraph), base prompt, and optionally a toolkit.

    Responsibilities:
    - Store metadata (name, role, etc.)
    - Hold a reference to the LangGraph (set via `graph`)
    - Compile the graph to run it
    - Optionally save it as an image (for visualization)

    Subclasses are responsible for defining any reasoning nodes (e.g. `reasoner`)
    and for calling `get_compiled_graph()` when they are ready to execute the agent.
