# Fred architecture notes for implementers:
# - Graphs are built PER INSTANCE (self._graph) in async_init().
#   Why: LangGraph nodes call bound methods (they require `self`) and often depend on
#   per-instance state (model bindings, user tuning, runtime context). Building at class
#   import time would capture unbound functions and the wrong lifecycle.
# - Tuning is declared at CLASS LEVEL (GeneralistExpert.tuning) because it is a static
#   “capability contract” for the UI. The user’s overrides live in AgentSettings.tuning
#   and are merged into the instance by AgentFlow.__init__/apply_settings.
# - No hidden prompt composition: each node explicitly decides which tuned text to use
#   and whether to include the (optional) user profile. This keeps behavior auditable.
