    Sentinel â€” Ops & Monitoring agent (OpenSearch + KPIs).

    - Keep the agent focused on reasoning/presentation.
    - Push all MCP client/tool refresh logic into MCPRuntime.
    - Use a resilient ToolNode so transient 401/stream issues turn into
      structured ToolMessages (not hard failures), then refresh MCP and continue.
