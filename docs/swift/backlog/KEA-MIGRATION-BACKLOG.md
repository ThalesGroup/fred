# Kea→Swift Migration Backlog

Epic: **MIGR-00** — Kea→Swift production cutover

This backlog tracks the workstreams needed to cut over from Kea (production) to
Swift (new architecture). Owner of each sub-item = the person doing the work.
Set `owner:` in `id-legend.yaml` when a ticket is picked up.

> **Operational source of truth:** [`ops/KEA_SWIFT_CUTOVER.md`](../ops/KEA_SWIFT_CUTOVER.md)
>
> **Detailed runbook:** [`ops/MIGRATION-CASTLE-TO-S3NS.html`](../ops/MIGRATION-CASTLE-TO-S3NS.html)
> (full procedure, organised by the four topics below — §1.1 identity · §1.4 data ·
> §1.2/§1.3 metadata · §1.5 products). This backlog holds the authoritative topic definitions.

## Migration model — vocabulary & order (READ FIRST — shared language)

Every migration discussion (chat, RFC, standup) uses **exactly these four topics**. They differ
in how they move and who owns them. Do not blur them.

| Topic | What it is | How it moves | Owner / tracked as |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **identity** | Keycloak realm `app`: **users** (the `sub`) + **groups**. The IDs everything else points at. | Keycloak-native export→import, **out-of-band**, **IDs preserved**, merged into the pre-existing target realm. **Not in the export zip.** | platform/ops — **MIGR-04** |
| **data** | Raw document **binaries** in MinIO (`*-documents/<document_uid>/input/…`). Irreplaceable. | `mc mirror`, **keys verbatim**, two-hop via the laptop. No key rewriting. | **MIGR-06** |
| **metadata** | Structured records: Postgres rows (`tag, metadata, resource, mcp-server, teammetadata, users, agent`) **+ OpenFGA tuples**. | The **export `.zip`** → import (this is the import service). | **MIGR-02** (transform) + **MIGR-05** (import service) |
| **products** | Derived, **reconstructable-from-data** artifacts: OpenSearch embeddings, processed markdown/media, tabular parquet. | **Not transported** — rebuilt on the target (re-vectorize). | **MIGR-07** |

**Fixed order** (identity must precede everything because metadata tuples reference identity IDs):

```
0. Freeze source (read-only) for a consistent capture
1. identity   — Keycloak export→import, IDs preserved          (MIGR-04)
2. data       — mc mirror the buckets, key-for-key             (MIGR-06)
3. metadata   — export zip → import (Postgres + OpenFGA)       (MIGR-02 + MIGR-05)
4. products   — re-vectorize on the target                     (MIGR-07)
5. verify + cutover; keep source as rollback
```

**Two runs, two ID disciplines:**
- **kea → kea** (castle → s3ns, the **first** run): same schema, same names both ends
  (DB `fred_kea`, store `kea`, buckets `kea-*`, index `kea-vector-index-mistral`, realm `app`).
  **No transformation** — a faithful mirror.
- **kea → swift** (later): identity & data assumptions hold unchanged; only **names map**
  (store `kea`→`fred`, buckets `kea-*`→unprefixed, index `kea-…`→`vector-index-mistral`).
  The **metadata transform** (agent `payload_json`→`agent_instance`, per-user personal teams,
  UUID-only user-tuple filter) is swift-specific — see [`PLATFORM-IMPORT-RFC`](../rfc/PLATFORM-IMPORT-RFC.md).

**Two ID shapes — never conflate:**
- **`document_uid`** = 32-hex (`3ac3729e2152447081df3717ce338ffe`). **The MinIO folder name.**
  The *only* join between a binary and the rest of the system:
  MinIO folder ⟷ `metadata.document_uid` ⟷ OpenFGA `document:<document_uid>`.
- **`tag_id` / `team_id` / `agent_id` / `resource_id`** = dashed UUID. **Never appear in MinIO
  paths** — they live only in metadata. A document's tag/team comes 100% from metadata, never
  from the object path.

**Identity sub-facts (settled):**
- Preserving user `sub` is critical — everything is keyed on it (identity topic, MIGR-04).
- **Migration note — teams are no longer Keycloak groups (2026-07-10).** This section previously
  asserted "a Keycloak group id = the team id" and "membership derives from Keycloak group claims,
  no `user→team` tuples to import." Both are now false for the swift target: AUTHZ-05 review item 9
  (`FRED-AUTHORIZATION-TARGET-MODEL-RFC.md` Part 6, `platform/REBAC.md`) made a team a
  `team_metadata` row (independently generated id, plus a required `name` column) with membership
  as **explicit** OpenFGA relation tuples (`team_admin`/`team_editor`/`team_analyst`/`team_member`)
  — no Keycloak group backs it. This was still true for kea itself (chapter 1 of the detailed
  runbook, kea↔kea, unaffected), and swift's `team_metadata.id` can still reuse a kea team's old
  group-id string (opaque to swift), but the **metadata** topic (MIGR-02/MIGR-05) must now write
  `user→team` tuples explicitly for every migrated team — see `PLATFORM-IMPORT-RFC.md` §2/§4 and
  `ops/MIGRATION-CASTLE-TO-S3NS.html` §"Migration model" for the corrected plan. Concrete import
  mechanics (source-team enumeration, tuple-writing order) are not yet designed.

---

## §0 Platform prerequisite — identity bootstrap (MIGR-04)

Must be completed and verified **before** any application data (Postgres `fred_kea`,
OpenFGA tuples) is imported into a target environment. Owned by platform/ops.

- [ ] **MIGR-04** — Bootstrap the target (S3NS) Keycloak by exporting on-prem users **with
  their `id` (UUID)** and importing them so each user's `sub` is preserved across environments.
  — *Fred keys all ownership and OpenFGA tuples on the Keycloak `sub`; a fresh Keycloak mints
  new UUIDs and orphans every user. SSO brokering alone preserves nothing.*
  — owner: platform/ops (Sébastien)
  — runbook: [`ops/KEYCLOAK-IDENTITY-BOOTSTRAP-S3NS.md`](../ops/KEYCLOAK-IDENTITY-BOOTSTRAP-S3NS.md)
  — acceptance: one real user logs into S3NS via SSO and their token `sub` equals their on-prem UUID
  — note: the application team rehearses the data migration locally with a **single shared
  Keycloak** (kea + swift), which faithfully models the post-bootstrap state; it does not test
  the bootstrap itself, which is why this item is owned by platform/ops.

---

## §0bis Platform import service (MIGR-05)

Full contract: [`PLATFORM-IMPORT-RFC.md`](../rfc/PLATFORM-IMPORT-RFC.md) — swift-native path
shipped + hardened; kea-import path (this checklist's `[ ]` items) deferred, tracked below.

- [x] **MIGR-05.01** — Bundle reader + manifest parse (`format_version 1`, kea + swift formats) — `import_export/bundle.py`
- [x] **MIGR-05.02** — Atomic import service (FastAPI `BackgroundTask` + single SQLAlchemy transaction; **not** Temporal): validate manifest → import agents → tags → metadata, all-or-nothing rollback, idempotent by PK — `import_export/importer.py` + `api.py`. *(Temporal design preserved in RFC §5 for future scale; fresh-target preflight + verify superseded by idempotent-by-PK + reset.)*
- [x] **MIGR-05.03** — Agent transform: kea `payload_json`/`class_path` → swift `agent_instance` (+ `KEA_TO_SWIFT_TEMPLATE` catalog; IGNORED skipped, GAP warned) — `import_export/agent_map.py` (+tests)
- [x] **MIGR-05.04** — OpenFGA tuple restore (2026-07-24, #1954) — `importer.py::transform_kea_tuples`,
  replacing the abandoned ops bulk-copy plan (Option A would have written kea relation names the
  swift model rejects — 63% of the tuples in the validated 2026-07-22 kea dump). Role mapping
  (approved): `owner→team_admin+team_editor`, `manager→team_editor`, `member→team_member`;
  `team_analyst` never synthesized. Dropped + counted: kea shared `team:personal` tuples (swift
  self-heals `personal-{uid}`), `resource#parent` (resources become prompt rows), non-UUID user
  subjects. Residual: no per-identity Keycloak existence check (tuples for unknown subs are inert).
- [x] **MIGR-05.05** — `MigrationTaskEvent` populated (`step`/`progress`/`MigrationDetail`) + control-plane wired into frontend task rehydration & SSE sources (tasks survive reload)
- [x] **MIGR-05.06** — Admin UI import page (upload zip → launch → task-atom progress, admin-only) — *fully wired to the live backend; page renamed **Platform data***
- [x] **MIGR-05.07** — Stage reconciliation: reset each restored document's `VECTORIZED`/
  `SQL_INDEXED` → `NOT_STARTED` (never transported), `PREVIEW_READY` untouched. Closed by
  MIGR-05.13 (`importer.py::_reset_transported_stages`) — the metadata-import phase is shared code,
  not swift-only, so this applies to both the swift-native and kea-import paths. *Still inert until
  MIGR-07's re-vectorize trigger actually consumes the reset — two ends of one flow.*
  — RFC: [`PLATFORM-IMPORT-RFC`](../rfc/PLATFORM-IMPORT-RFC.md) §5
- [x] **MIGR-05.08** — Tags + document-metadata import phases (atomic, shared generic loop) — `import_export/importer.py`; new `fred_core/documents/tag_models.py` `TagRow`
- [x] **MIGR-05.09** — Swift-native **export** (`GET /import-export/export`) + re-import branch (`source_platform=swift`, bypasses `agent_map`) — `import_export/exporter.py`
- [x] **MIGR-05.10** — Atomic **reset** (`POST /import-export/reset`) — wipes agents+tags+metadata in one transaction; enables export → reset → import test cycles (object store / Keycloak / OpenFGA untouched)
- [x] **MIGR-05.11** — Agent prompt transfer (2026-07-24, #1954). Implemented differently from the
  original sketch: the kea prompt (`system_prompt_template` v2 / `prompts.system` v1, from
  `payload_json.tuning.fields[].default`) is written to `tuning.values["prompts.system"]` — the
  key the runtime actually overlays onto the template's system prompt
  (`fred_runtime/app/agent_app.py`). `prompt_refs_json` is left unset: it has no consumer in the
  codebase, and kea agent prompts were never library entries. `role`/`description`/`tags`/
  `created_by` also transfer; v1 secondary per-node prompts are warned (no swift field).
  — RFC: [`PLATFORM-IMPORT-RFC`](../rfc/PLATFORM-IMPORT-RFC.md) §8
- [x] **MIGR-05.12** — Platform-data stats dashboard (`GET /import-export/stats`): teams, members by
  role, agents, prompts; personal spaces (`personal-*`) aggregated into one row — `import_export/stats.py`
- [x] **MIGR-05.13** — Manifest contract hardening: `SnapshotManifest` → Pydantic + enforced
  `format_version`/`users_schema_version` (reject unknown, no silent default) — `bundle.py`; honest
  `content_keys` (populated on export, surfaced as a single count-warning on import — not a
  per-document content-store probe, that's a future MIGR-06-side improvement) instead of an
  always-`[]` placeholder — `exporter.py`/`importer.py`. Also closed MIGR-05.07 (stage
  reconciliation) as a side effect, since it touched the same shared metadata-import phase. Tests:
  `tests/test_import_export_manifest.py` (5 new). — RFC:
  [`PLATFORM-IMPORT-RFC`](../rfc/PLATFORM-IMPORT-RFC.md) §4–§5
- [x] **MIGR-05.14** — Kea bundle compatibility fixes (2026-07-24, #1954), found by running a real
  kea dump (2026-07-22) through the importer: (a) kea manifests predate `users_schema_version` →
  defaulted to 1 for `source_platform != "swift"` only (RFC §4 amended); (b) the team table file is
  `teammetadata.jsonl` on the kea path (main's `EXPORT_TABLES` name) vs `team_metadata.jsonl`
  (swift-native) — the importer now asks for the right file per producer; (c) legacy
  `payload_json.type == "leader"` agent rows skipped. Tests: `tests/test_import_export_kea_bundle.py`.
- [x] **MIGR-05.15** — Chat contexts → personal prompts (2026-07-24, #1954, decision: personal
  space only). Kea `resource` rows (`resource_type="chat-context"`) become `prompt` rows in
  `personal-{author}`; YAML front-matter stripped (body only); `prompt_id` = kea `resource_id`
  (idempotent); `(team_id, name)` collisions suffixed; kinds `prompt`/`template` skipped with a
  warning; kea library tags (`chat-context`/`prompt`/`template`) filtered from the tag phase.
  — RFC: [`PLATFORM-IMPORT-RFC`](../rfc/PLATFORM-IMPORT-RFC.md) §8

- [x] **MIGR-05.16** — Teams & platform roles from the bundled Keycloak realm export
  (2026-07-24, #1954). Every tuple-referenced team now gets a swift `teammetadata` row: name ←
  `keycloak/realm.json` groups (kea's only team-name store), customization merged from the kea
  row when present; no realm in the bundle → named by id + warning. When the realm export is a
  FULL one (`kc export --users`), per-user `realmRoles` re-provision platform roles
  (`admin→platform_admin`, `viewer→platform_observer`, `editor` dropped + warned); a
  partial-export carries no users → `users.json`/bootstrap remains the channel. Ops fallback for
  both: SQL on the Keycloak DB (`keycloak_group`, `user_role_mapping`×`keycloak_role`).

**Open (cutover items — see RFC §8 follow-ups):**
- Kea-side realm-export 403: `manage-realm` alone does not satisfy `partial-export?exportClients=true`
  (needs `view-clients`, or export without clients). Must be fixed on the kea source before the
  prod dump, else teams arrive unnamed and platform roles must be provisioned via `users.json`.
- `users` table rows (GCU acceptance) exported but not imported — decide: re-prompt everyone on
  swift (current behaviour) or add a users-row import phase. Per-user/team storage counters are
  covered separately by `knowledge-flow/alembic/backfill/backfill_storage_usage.py` (add to runbook).

## §0ter Data — document binaries (MIGR-06)

The **data** topic: mirror MinIO buckets **key-for-key** through the laptop bridge (no key
rewriting; team/tag reorganisation lives in metadata, never in object paths). ~25 GB.

- [ ] **MIGR-06.01** — Documented two-hop `mc mirror` procedure (source → encrypted laptop disk → target), buckets: `*-knowledge-flow-content-documents`, `*-knowledge-flow-content-objects`, `*-filesystem`
- [ ] **MIGR-06.02** — Integrity check: object-count reconciliation source vs target (per bucket / per `document_uid` prefix)
- [ ] **MIGR-06.03** — Encryption-at-rest of the bundle on the laptop during transit
  — note: banners live in the metadata zip, **not** in the data mirror
  — kea→swift delta: bucket names map (`kea-*` → unprefixed); keys (`document_uid/…`) unchanged

---

## §0quater Products — re-vectorization (MIGR-07)

The **products** topic: embeddings and other derived artifacts are **rebuilt on the target**,
not transported. Because `input/` **and** `output/` are mirrored together, only embeddings
(OpenSearch `*-vector-index-mistral`) must be regenerated. Design:
[`CORPUS-REVECTORIZE-RFC`](../rfc/CORPUS-REVECTORIZE-RFC.md) — redesign the **existing stubbed**
`/corpus/revectorize` endpoint onto a Temporal workflow over the existing `output_process` activity,
streaming progress via the fred-core task/event API (reuses `IngestionDetail`).

- [ ] **MIGR-07.01** — `list_documents_in_scope` activity (metadata query by tag_ids/library/document_uids/source_tag)
- [ ] **MIGR-07.02** — `RevectorizeCorpusWorkflow` + `RevectorizeDocument` workflows (batch fan-out, reuse `output_process`); register in scheduler worker
- [ ] **MIGR-07.03** — Wire the `/corpus/revectorize` stub to start the workflow + `task_service.start`; incremental/full/force semantics
- [ ] **MIGR-07.04** — Migration UI "Rebuild embeddings" final step (reuse task atoms); reconcile vector `_count` vs metadata row count
  — kea→swift delta: same embedding model → vectors compatible; index name maps
  — RFC: [`CORPUS-REVECTORIZE-RFC`](../rfc/CORPUS-REVECTORIZE-RFC.md)

## §1 Cherry-picks and code adaptations (MIGR-01)

Commits or features from the Kea codebase that need to be cherry-picked or
re-implemented for Swift. For each item, note the source commit/PR and what
adaptation is needed (e.g. API contract change, dependency replacement).

## §2 Postgres data/schema migration and backfill scripts for Fred tables(MIGR-02)

Schema diffs and backfill scripts for existing production data.
Each row represents one backfill script or migration step.

### Required

- [ ] **MIGR-02.01** — Cherry-pick `created_at` / `updated_at` timestamps on all ORM tables
  — *Prerequisite for KPI queries on production data*
  — depends on: MIGR-01.04 (same commit, must land first)

- [ ] **MIGR-02.02** — Backfill script: migrate data from `agent` → `agent_instance`, then drop `agent`
  — *`agent` table is the Kea model; Swift uses `agent_instance` — production data must be migrated before cutover*

### Optional

- [ ] **MIGR-02.03** — Backfill script: migrate conversations from `session` → `session_metadata`
  — *Table rename between Kea and Swift; existing sessions would be lost without this*

- [ ] **MIGR-02.04** — Handle `session_history` schema change
  — *Schema differs between Kea and Swift; assess: migrate in place, transform, or accept history loss*

---

## §3 Feature parity — Kea features missing in Swift (MIGR-03)

Features present in Kea production that are not yet in Swift.
For each item: assess whether to port as-is, adapt to Swift architecture, or drop
with a written rationale.

- [ ] **MIGR-03.01** — Session attachments — add document to a conversation directly
  — *Users could attach documents inline in a chat session in Kea*

- [ ] **MIGR-03.02** — Message feedback — leave a rating with 5 stars and a comment on a chat message
  — *Feedback feature was available in Kea; used for quality monitoring*

- [x] **MIGR-03.03** — Source citation in chat — display source references alongside agent responses
  — *Kea showed which documents/sources were used in the response*
  — Restored kea's inprocess `kf_vector_search` provider for the "search_documents"
    tool so it returns typed `VectorSearchHit` sources (Sources panel + `[N]`
    citations) instead of the remote-MCP plain-text path that dropped them.
  — Execution: branch `1883-fred-202-rgpd-ready-increment-ctrlp-12`. Touches
    `libs/fred-runtime/fred_runtime/integrations/kf_vector_search/`,
    `inprocess_toolkit_registry.py`, `mcp_catalog.yaml`, `deploy/charts/fred/values.yaml`.
