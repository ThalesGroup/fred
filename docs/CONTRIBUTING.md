  - Motivation and expected behavior (if a feature)

---

## üéØ Coding Style

- Follow the existing formatting and structure.
- Write **clear, consistent, and maintainable** code.
- Prefer readability and clarity over cleverness.
- We recommend using tools such as `prettier` in Javascript or `black` (or `ruff`) in Python to format your code.
- Please respect the conventions in effect for the following languages : PEP8 in Python and ECMAScript in Javascript

### Code formatting

#### Frontend

For the frontend part we use the [prettier](https://prettier.io/) code formatter.

With the [prettier vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and by adding this to your `.vscode/settings.json` your code will format automaticaly on every file save:
```json
{
    "[typescriptreact]": {
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "[typescript]": {
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "[json]": {
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    }
}
```

You can also run it from the terminal to format all the frontend files in one command:

```sh
cd frontend
make format
```

### Resources

- [Conventional Commits Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

### VSCode

- Extension for easier commit writing : [VSCode Conventional Commits](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits)
- Extansion for ruff (python linter and formatter) : [Ruff extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff) 

### Clean Commit History

If your branch has a messy or noisy commit history (e.g. "fix typo", "oops", "test again", etc.), we encourage you to squash your commits before merging.

Squashing helps keep the main branch history clean, readable, and easier to debug.

Tip: Use git rebase -i or select "Squash and merge" when merging the PR.


---

## üéØ Pre-commit checks

To ensure the code you are about to push is quite clean and safe, we provide some pre-commit hooks:

- Check PEP8 compliance and fix errors if possible: `ruff check --fix`
- Format the code: `ruff format`
- Detect secrets: `detect-secrets`  # pragma: allowlist secret

- Analyzer the code: `bandit`

To install the pre commit hooks on your environment after it is ready (see the `dev` target of the Makefile), type this command:
```
pre-commit install
```

Then you can test manually the hooks with this command:
```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

---

## üß™ Testing

Testing is mandatory for any non-trivial change. Both unit and integration tests are run using `pytest`.

### Recommended workflow:

```bash
make run       # start the app locally
make test      # run all tests (unit + integration)
```

Ensure tests pass **before** opening a pull request.

### üß© `conftest.py` and Configuration for Local Testing

Both the `agentic_backend` and `knowledge_flow_backend` components include a centralized `app/tests/conftest.py` file. This shared testing convention plays a crucial role in keeping the test environments **robust, isolated, and developer-friendly**.

#### Why this matters:

- **Isolated unit testing**: Each backend runs with a minimal local configuration (no OpenSearch, Keycloak, or external LLMs). This avoids coupling unit tests with infrastructure.
- **Reliable app context**: The `ApplicationContext` is initialized with a handcrafted in-memory config (e.g., `minimal_generalist_config()` in `agentic_backend`), which provides just enough structure for testing core logic.
- **No noise from immature configs**: Since the production `configuration.yaml` files are still evolving, using a custom `conftest.py` config helps avoid boilerplate or fragile test setups.
- **Developer clarity**: The fixtures make it obvious how to initialize services, mock agents, or plug in `TestClient` with mounted routers‚Äîwithout needing to run the whole stack.
- **Scalable to integration tests**: You can keep using this base and extend it later with additional marks (`@pytest.mark.integration`) or Docker-based services.

#### How to use it:

- For **unit tests**, rely on the `client` or `test_app` fixture in `conftest.py` to get a ready-to-use FastAPI client.
- For **controller or agent logic**, use the initialized context and override only what‚Äôs necessary.
- When needed, you can mock service behavior using `monkeypatch` or swap components like `AIService`, `SessionStorage`, etc.

By following this pattern consistently in both backends, we ensure clean separation of concerns, easier debugging, and faster CI iterations.
