## Current Priority: Gate Before Phase 6A

Two backend items must close before Félix starts the Chat UI (Phase 6A).
They can run in parallel between Simon and Florian.

```
Simon ──────[ S1: E2E validation ]──────────────────────────────────────┐
                                                                         ├──► Félix: Phase 6A
Florian ────[ F1: updated_at strategy + impl ]──────────────────────────┘
```

## S1 — Backend E2E Validation (Simon) · Phase 3b gate

**Why**: the SSE execution chain has never been formally validated without the frontend.
All UI work that follows rests on this foundation.

**Ref**: `docs/backlog/BACKLOG.md` §3b.7

**Scenario automation complete (2026-04-26)** — scenarios now run via `pytest -m integration` or
`make test-integration-only` in `apps/fred-agents`. No manual CLI replay needed.

| Scenario file | Description | Env var required |
|---|---|---|
| `s1_raw_echo.yaml` | Raw `agent_id` path, echo turn | none |
| `s1_managed_echo.yaml` | Managed path via `agent_instance_id` | `FRED_AGENT_INSTANCE_ID` |
| `s1_hitl_resume.yaml` | HITL two-phase pause + resume | none |

Three scenarios to validate, in order:

1. **[x] Scenario automation wired** — `run_scenario_file()` supports `agent_instance_id`, HITL steps, env-var substitution, `history_has_messages` + `kpi_turn_recorded` checks
2. **[ ] Live stack validation** — run `make test-integration-only` with pod up + `FRED_AGENT_INSTANCE_ID` set
   - Tick `[ ] one managed execution works end-to-end from fred-agent-chat`
   - Tick `[ ] one managed HITL resume flow works end-to-end from fred-agent-chat`
   - Tick `[ ] one runtime capability reachable through raw agent_id also works correctly through team-scoped managed execution`

**Done when**: all three ticked in BACKLOG.md §3b.7 after live stack run.

## F1 — Session `updated_at` Strategy (Florian) · Phase 6 gate

**Why**: the sidebar sorts sessions by `updated_at`. Today this field is set at session creation and never updated. Every conversation appears in creation order, not activity order.

**Ref**: `docs/backlog/BACKLOG.md` §6.4.D

**Decision to make first** (needs alignment, ~30min sync):

| Option | Mechanism | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| A | Frontend sends `PATCH /sessions/{id}` after each `turn_persisted` event | Simple, but couples frontend to control-plane on the hot path |
| B | Runtime notifies control-plane via async queue after each `final` | Clean separation, slightly more infra |
| C | Sidebar sorts by frontend-local timestamp, `updated_at` stays stale | Degrades on reload but unblocks immediately |

**Recommended starting point**: Option A — simplest, no new infra, correct for the current scale.

**Tasks**:
- [x] Decide and document option in BACKLOG.md §6.4.D
- [x] If A: implement `PATCH /control-plane/v1/teams/{team_id}/sessions/{session_id}` (body: `{ updated_at }`)
- [ ] If A: wire call in `ManagedChatPage` on each `turn_persisted` SSE event (Félix, after F1 lands)
- [x] `make code-quality && make test` in `control-plane-backend`

## S2 — Prometheus Cardinality Fix + Observability Hardening (Simon/Dimitri) · Closed 2026-04-26

**Why**: `session_id` and `user_id` as Prometheus label dimensions create unbounded cardinality. Also closes the turn-level KPI gap and opens a dedicated security audit channel.

**Ref**: `docs/backlog/BACKLOG.md` §7.3, §7.6, §7.7

- [x] Remove `session_id` from Prometheus labels emitted from runtime KPI dims
- [x] Remove `user_id` from Prometheus labels emitted from runtime KPI dims
- [x] Keep both in structured KPI log output (OpenSearch / log backend)
- [x] Same cleanup for graph/KF phase timers via the shared Prometheus KPI sink
- [x] `exchange_id` propagated to Langfuse trace metadata via `context.baggage`
- [x] `_emit_turn_completed()` wired to **non-streaming `execute()` path** (was streaming-only)
- [x] `KpiLogStore.index_event()` fixed: now logs structured JSON for `agent.turn_completed`,
  `agent.turn_error_total`, `agent.tool_failed_total` (was silent no-op)
- [x] Pod ring buffers (`_KPI_TURNS_BUFFER`, `_AUDIT_EVENTS_BUFFER`) + endpoints
  `GET /agents/kpi-turns` and `GET /agents/audit-events`
- [x] `/kpi [limit]` CLI command — per-turn ring buffer view with current-session highlight
- [x] Dedicated `fred.security.audit` logger + audit ring buffer; events emitted at all
  auth boundaries (`grant_validated`, `grant_validation_failed`, `grant_user_mismatch`)
- [x] `/audit [limit]` CLI command — security audit event table with colour coding
- [x] `_emit_audit_event()` helper: mutualize all audit event emission (ring buffer + logger);
  fixes `grant_validation_failed` not reaching the ring buffer
- [x] `Quantities` model: add `tool_count`, `input_tokens`, `output_tokens` with `None` defaults;
  change pipeline fields from `= 0` to `= None` — turn KPI quantities were silently discarded
- [x] `datetime.utcnow()` → `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` at all 4 sites
- [x] `asyncio.ensure_future` → `asyncio.create_task`
- [x] Unit tests: `_emit_audit_event`, ring buffer endpoints, `_emit_turn_completed` via execute,
  `KpiLogStore.index_event()` (structured JSON, error events, unknown name filter)
- [x] `make code-quality && make test` in `fred-core` (31 tests) and `fred-runtime` (62 tests)

## Phase 6A — Chat UI Architecture (Félix) · Starts after S1 + F1

**Ref**: `docs/backlog/CHAT-UI-BACKLOG.md` §1

Build the new component tree for `ManagedChatPage`. No markdown yet. Full spec in the backlog.

**Component build order** (sequential within Félix's track):

```
[x] Step 1 — Atoms (no deps):
      MessageBubble · StreamingCursor · ToolBadge · TogglePanelButton
      (SourceBadge deferred to Phase 6B)

[x] Step 2 — Molecules (need atoms):
      UserMessage · AssistantMessage · ChatInputBar
      TraceEntryRow · TraceDetailDrawer · ThoughtTrace
      SourceCard · SourcesPanel

[x] Step 3 — Organisms (need molecules):
      ChatMessagesArea · AssistantTurn

[x] Step 4 — Refactor ManagedChatPage (new components + three-column layout)

[ ] Step 5 — Map SSE events to ConversationMessage state
[ ] Step 6 — Normalise history from runtime messages_url_template
```

**Validation criteria** (must pass before 6B starts):
- User messages right-aligned, agent messages left-aligned
- StreamingCursor visible during delta, gone on final
- ThinkingAccordion opens on first tool_call, closes on final
- SourcesPanel appears when final event carries sources
- ChatInputBar disabled while streaming
- HITL flow unaffected
- History renders identically to streamed messages
- `make code-quality` green on frontend

---

## Phase 6B — Markdown Rendering (Félix) · After 6A

**Ref**: `docs/backlog/CHAT-UI-BACKLOG.md` §2

- [ ] Audit `package.json` for `react-markdown`
- [ ] Document library choice in CHAT-UI-BACKLOG.md §2.2 before writing code
- [ ] Implement `MarkdownRenderer` molecule
- [ ] Implement `CodeBlock` molecule (monospace + copy)
- [ ] Wire into `AssistantMessage` only

---

## F2 — PATCH Session Endpoint (Florian) · Before Phase 6C

**Ref**: `docs/backlog/BACKLOG.md` §6.4.D, `docs/backlog/CHAT-UI-BACKLOG.md` §3

Needed for inline session title editing in Phase 6C.

- [ ] `PATCH /control-plane/v1/teams/{team_id}/sessions/{session_id}` — body: `{ title?, status? }`
- [ ] Authorization: same team membership check as POST
- [ ] `make code-quality && make test` in `control-plane-backend`
- [ ] Regenerate `controlPlaneOpenApi.ts`

Can be implemented in parallel with Phase 6A/6B (no frontend dependency yet).

---

## O1 — Agent Evaluation Track (Olélia) · Parallel, independent

**Ref**: `docs/rfc/AGENT-EVALUATION-RFC.md`

This track is independent of the migration and UI work.
Coordinate with Simon/Florian when backend evaluation hooks are needed.

Current state: RFC exists, no implementation started.

**Suggested first steps**:
- [ ] Confirm scope: which agents, which datasets, which deepeval metrics
- [ ] Identify whether evaluation needs a dedicated runtime endpoint or CLI-only
- [ ] Draft evaluation harness structure in `apps/` or a standalone eval runner
- [ ] Align with Simon on any runtime observability hooks needed (exchange_id, token usage)

---

## D1 — Control-Plane Developer CLI · Important next backend ergonomics track

**Ref**: `docs/backlog/CONTROL-PLANE-CLI-BACKLOG.md`

**Why**: `fred-agent-chat` gives us a first-class runtime validation console, but
we still lack an equivalent terminal workflow for the control-plane product and
admin surface. As `control-plane-backend` becomes the sole authority for
managed-agent lifecycle, runtime binding, and execution preparation, this gap is
becoming operationally expensive.

**Intent**:
- give `control-plane-backend` its own `make cli` developer/operator console
- keep runtime-specific chat behavior in `fred-runtime`
- move only truly shared CLI primitives into `fred-core`
- explicitly defer the `knowledge-flow` CLI until after `knowledge-flow-backend`
  is moved under `apps/`

**Current status (2026-04-25)**:
- [x] Freeze placement rules: shared CLI primitives in `fred-core`, runtime
      chat in `fred-runtime`, control-plane commands in
      `control-plane-backend`
- [x] Add one dedicated control-plane console script + `make cli`
- [x] Deliver MVP commands for templates, instances, enrollment, runtime
      binding, sessions, execution preparation, and lifecycle/policy inspection
- [x] Keep `knowledge-flow` CLI out of scope for this track
- [x] `make code-quality` and `make test` pass in `control-plane-backend`
- [x] `make code-quality` and `make test` pass in `libs/fred-core`
- [x] `make code-quality` and `make test` pass in `libs/fred-runtime`
- [ ] Run one live stack validation in no-security mode
- [ ] Run one live stack validation in Keycloak-enabled mode
- [ ] Run one operator happy path for enroll / unbind / prepare-execution

## S3 — Runtime CLI Ergonomics + Session Purge (Simon/Dimitri) · Closed 2026-04-26

**Ref**: `docs/backlog/BACKLOG.md` §6.4.B, §6.4.G

Completed in one session — no outstanding items.

- [x] `fred.test.assistant` graph agent (no LLM): exercises `echo`, `hitl choice`, `hitl text`,
  `trace`+sources, `error`, `long` scenarios; registered in `apps/fred-agents` registry
- [x] History schema: `Channel.hitl_request` / `Channel.hitl_response`, `HitlRequestPart`,
  `HitlResponsePart`, `make_hitl_request` / `make_hitl_response` factories; sources extracted
  from `final` payload and stored in `ChatMetadata.sources` (see BACKLOG.md §6.4.F)
- [x] Session purge stack: `delete_session()` on `BaseHistoryStore`, `PostgresHistoryStore`,
  `HistoryStorePort`; `DELETE /agents/sessions/{session_id}` pod endpoint; client methods
  `delete_session_messages()` + `delete_checkpoint()` (see BACKLOG.md §6.4.B)
- [x] CLI commands: `/session-info`, `/session-new`, `/session <N>` index switching,
  `/sessions` with preview, `/whoami` full identity panel, `/history --raw`,
  `/delete-session`, `/delete-checkpoint`, `/purge-session` (see BACKLOG.md §6.4.G)
- [x] `make code-quality` and `make test` green in `fred-core` and `fred-runtime`

## Open Decisions (need sync before implementation)

| Decision | Owner | Blocking |
|---|---|---|
| Option A/B/C for `updated_at` freshness | Florian + all | F1, then Félix 6A wiring |
| Whether `ExecutionPreparation` should expose agent runtime options | Simon + Florian | Félix 6C scope |
| Checkpoint TTL policy for standalone mode | Simon | BACKLOG.md §3b.9, non-urgent |
| `session_purge_queue` keep or repurpose | Florian | BACKLOG.md §6.4.E, non-urgent |
