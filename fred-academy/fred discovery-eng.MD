# Express Hackathon ‚Äì Discovering Fred

Objective: Get hands-on with Thales‚Äô Fred project, explore its AI agent capabilities, knowledge management features, and customize a few components.

## Prerequisites

- A machine with Docker or the ability to run services locally (see documentation).
- Access to the repository: https://github.com/ThalesGroup/fred
- Node.js and Python installed according to the ‚ÄúGetting Started‚Äù guide.
- Ideally, a recent web browser and internet access.

## Ressources

- Fred ‚ÄúGetting Started‚Äù guide: https://fredk8.dev/docs/guides/getting-started/
- Fred architecture & design paper: Fred: A Modular Multi-Agent AI Assistant for Kubernetes
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/ThalesGroup/fred
- Quick solutions/corrections will be shared as toggles under each exercise.

## Tips for Success

- Start by launching the system and familiarize yourself with the UI.
- For each exercise, note your changes and observe their effects.
- If you get stuck, move on and return later.
- Don‚Äôt forget to test your modifications (e.g., start a conversation, ask a question‚Ä¶).
- Ask the facilitator if you need help!

## How to Launch FRED

### Launching Fred via the Dev Container

1 - Clone the Fred repository:

5 - Open the UI in your browser: http://localhost:5173/chat

## üß© Practical Exercises

### 1. Getting Started with the UI & Basic Agent

- Launch Fred in academy mode.
- Select the agent llm_responder and ask it a question.

### 2. Customize Chat with ‚ÄúChat Profiles‚Äù

- Create a chat profile. Example:
"You are an Italian teacher agent. For every question I ask, respond only in Italian. Your goal is to help me learn Italian as fast as possible."
- Start a test conversation using this profile and observe how responses differ.

### 3. Customize an Agent via the UI + Fine-Tuning Settings

- Select the generalist agent Georges in the UI and ask a question.
- Modify its system prompt and note changes in its behavior.
- Start a new conversation to compare before/after behaviors.

### 4. Add a Response Template in Agent > Assets

- Add a template in the agent‚Äôs Assets Management section.
- Test and note differences in responses with and without the template.

### 5. Monitoring / Logs

- Go to Monitoring > KPIs to analyze Fred‚Äôs usage during your session.
- Go to Monitoring > Logs.
- Restart the two backends and examine their logs to understand internal backend processes.

### 6. Upload & Explore a PDF Document

- Import a Markdown or PDF document into Fred.
- Verify that associated objects are created: preview, markdown/pdf conversion, metadata objects.
- If a vector engine (e.g., ChromaDB) is configured, explore the embeddings generated.
- Ask a relevant query and check if the document appears in results.

### 7. Upload & Explore a CSV Document

- Import a CSV file into Fred.
- Verify that associated objects are created: preview, conversion, addition to the SQL database.
- Explore any tables created in the database.
- Ask a relevant query and check if the document appears in results.

### 8. Display Messages Between AI, Tools, and Humans (Debug Mode)

- Launch agentic backend in debug mode.
- Run one or two simple queries and observe the processing flow: agent ‚Üí model ‚Üí vector DB ‚Üí response.
- Identify key points in the agent to inspect transmitted messages.
- Read messages exchanged between Fred components.

### 9. Test Another Model Provider

- Modify configuration.yaml in the agentic backend to switch between a ‚Äúlocal‚Äù vs. ‚Äúcloud‚Äù model.
- Compare results: response time, style, cost, and configuration complexity.
- Document your observations.

### 10. Explore the Knowledge-Flow API Documentation

- Launch Knowledge-Flow.
- Explore endpoints at: http://localhost:8111/knowledge-flow/v1/docs
