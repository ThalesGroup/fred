## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Administrators compose understandable bounded predicates

The editor SHALL support one to sixteen conditions combined by either all (AND) or any (OR), with localized labels. Each condition SHALL select an unambiguous claim path, operator, operand and explicit case handling. Operators SHALL include literal equals/not-equals, contains/not-contains, and advanced whole-value regex. Literal metacharacters SHALL NOT be interpreted as regex. Literal comparison SHALL default to ignoring case; administrators SHALL be able to select case-sensitive comparison. For nonempty string arrays, positive predicates SHALL match any element and negative predicates SHALL require all elements to satisfy the negation. Missing, empty, incompatible and oversized values SHALL fail every predicate. Invalid input SHALL be rejected before saving; bounded regex timeouts SHALL NOT establish rule-derived admission.

The policy SHALL expose allow/block mode above the conditions and persist it in the shared authority; absent mode SHALL retain allow behavior. Allow mode SHALL derive admission from matching rules. Block mode SHALL derive admission from nonmatching rules, including verified missing, empty or incompatible claims. Independent user/team admission sources SHALL remain sufficient in either mode. A timeout SHALL NOT derive admission. Delegated rule-derived admission SHALL require fresh, unconflicted evidence covering all selected claim paths. Preview SHALL show effective admission with readable green/red accents and a larger heading while separately explaining condition matching.

Condition controls SHALL share a compact row when space permits and reflow without horizontal overflow on narrow screens. A labeled left-aligned dropdown SHALL expose root text field names and the exact selected path, with an entry for the detailed session explorer. After field confirmation a separate popup SHALL offer explicit reuse of the current verified account value or retention of the existing operand; copying SHALL respect operand bounds and regex literal escaping. A small case toggle SHALL remain directly visible, and manual path entry SHALL NOT be shown. Validation feedback SHALL remain visible and associated with its input. Operand counters SHALL appear at 90% of the existing limit without relaxing that limit. Condition removal SHALL identify the affected condition and SHALL preserve at least one condition. Adding a condition SHALL be separate from testing/saving the whole draft.

#### Scenario: Literal input contains regex punctuation

- **WHEN** a contains condition uses `a.b` and a claim contains `aXb` but not `a.b`
- **THEN** that condition SHALL fail without interpreting the period as a wildcard

#### Scenario: Missing negative claim

- **WHEN** a not-contains or not-equals condition references a missing, empty or incompatible claim
- **THEN** it SHALL fail rather than grant access through absence

#### Scenario: Array contains an excluded element

- **WHEN** one array member contains the operand of a not-contains condition
- **THEN** that condition SHALL fail even when another member does not contain it

#### Scenario: Administrator chooses all or any

- **WHEN** exactly one of two valid conditions matches
- **THEN** all SHALL fail and any SHALL match

#### Scenario: Regex is invalid or exceeds its budget

- **WHEN** a draft has an invalid regex
- **THEN** save SHALL fail with field feedback and retain the current policy
- **WHEN** evaluating a saved rule exhausts its regex budget
- **THEN** the rule SHALL NOT grant access, while independent admission sources remain available

#### Scenario: Compact editing preserves draft behavior

- **WHEN** an administrator selects a field, changes a comparison or value, or selects a nested path in the explorer
- **THEN** selection and editing SHALL affect only the draft, and exact paths and explicit case handling SHALL be retained
- **AND** preview/save and concurrent-revision safeguards SHALL remain available

#### Scenario: Narrow screen or long path

- **WHEN** the editor has a narrow viewport or a long selected path
- **THEN** controls SHALL remain operable without horizontal overflow and the full selected path SHALL remain accessible

#### Scenario: Hidden counter and validation feedback

- **WHEN** a short operand has invalid input feedback
- **THEN** the counter SHALL remain hidden while feedback remains visible and associated with the input
- **WHEN** the operand reaches 90% of its limit
- **THEN** its counter SHALL become visible and native input limits SHALL remain enforced

#### Scenario: Administrator declines current value reuse

- **WHEN** a selected field has a current text value and the administrator declines copying it
- **THEN** only the draft claim path SHALL change and the existing operand SHALL remain intact
- **AND** neither choice SHALL save the policy automatically

#### Scenario: Block mode with independent exception

- **WHEN** a person matches a block rule and has a current user exception or authorized/Free membership
- **THEN** the independent source SHALL admit them

#### Scenario: Block mode with absent claim

- **WHEN** the verified token lacks the selected claim and the combined block rule does not match
- **THEN** the rule SHALL permit admission

#### Scenario: Block mode with unobserved delegated path

- **WHEN** delegated evidence does not cover a newly selected claim path
- **THEN** that evidence SHALL NOT establish rule-derived admission until a fresh direct observation

### Requirement: Administrators select claims using their own verified session

The rule editor SHALL offer observed root text attribute names in its dropdown, excluding token protocol metadata; the detailed explorer SHALL default to selectable root text attributes from the connected administrator's own verified access-token claims. The observed-name catalog SHALL use the same root-text and metadata restrictions by default. An explicit advanced-fields action SHALL expose the complete bounded searchable JSON tree and catalog, including nested paths and string arrays. Changing display mode SHALL clear pending field selection and copied values without modifying the rule draft. Only compatible bounded string/string-array paths SHALL be selectable. In advanced mode, unsupported values SHALL be visible with an explanation; omitted oversized values SHALL be indicated. Selected keys SHALL preserve their exact nested path without interpreting literal dots. After confirming a field, administrators SHALL explicitly choose in a separate popup whether to reuse a current string or array element from their own verified account or retain the entered operand. Field selection SHALL modify only the draft; existing AND/OR, preview, save and concurrent-revision safeguards SHALL remain in effect. Observed names/types SHALL remain available; exact paths SHALL be selected through the explorer rather than manual entry. The view SHALL be restricted to own human credentials and platform administration, SHALL NOT expose bearer tokens, signatures or other users' values, SHALL NOT persist or log payload values, and SHALL NOT retain the response after dismissal.

#### Scenario: Select a nested claim from the real session

- **WHEN** the administrator opens the picker and selects a nested string key in their verified payload
- **THEN** its exact path SHALL populate the draft and its real value SHALL be reusable only through an explicit action

#### Scenario: Select an array or literal dotted key

- **WHEN** the administrator selects a string array or a key containing a period
- **THEN** the condition SHALL target the whole array or literal key respectively, and copying an array value SHALL select one element

#### Scenario: Unsupported value or bounded projection

- **WHEN** a token contains a numeric/boolean claim or exceeds projection bounds
- **THEN** incompatible or unavailable fields SHALL NOT be selectable and the limitation SHALL be explained

#### Scenario: Another principal requests token values

- **WHEN** a non-administrator, workload or delegated principal requests the own-claims view
- **THEN** no token payload values SHALL be returned

#### Scenario: Choose a root account attribute without token metadata

- **WHEN** an administrator opens either claim source in the default mode
- **THEN** root text account attributes SHALL be shown, while token metadata, nested paths, arrays and non-text values SHALL remain hidden

#### Scenario: Return from advanced fields

- **WHEN** an administrator selects an advanced field and switches back to simple fields
- **THEN** the hidden selection and copied operand SHALL be cleared, while saved rules and the existing draft SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement: Admission policy is managed and activated by administrators

Admission administration SHALL be available in authenticated Fred deployments with enforced ReBAC after the required shared SQL migration. Its policy and activation SHALL be controlled exclusively by versioned durable administrator state. There SHALL be no admission-specific YAML, Helm, SDK environment or Pydantic configuration model, and no deployment seed. An absent authority SHALL initialize with no policy, revision zero and filtering inactive. Restarts SHALL preserve administrator state. Authentication-disabled development SHALL retain its existing behavior. Support destinations SHALL reuse frontend `contactSupportLink`.

#### Scenario: Configured nested attribute matches

- **WHEN** an administrator saves a nested claim condition in allow mode and explicitly activates filtering
- **THEN** a verified human token satisfying the condition SHALL establish rule-derived admission

#### Scenario: Attribute does not establish eligibility

- **WHEN** a selected claim is absent, empty, incompatible or fails its predicate
- **THEN** that predicate SHALL NOT match, including for negative operators; effective admission SHALL follow the combined rule, policy mode and independent sources

#### Scenario: Configuration omitted or invalid

- **WHEN** an authenticated deployment starts without any admission configuration
- **THEN** administration SHALL be available and an absent SQL authority SHALL begin with filtering inactive
- **WHEN** an administrator submits an invalid rule
- **THEN** the API SHALL reject it without changing policy or filtering

#### Scenario: UI policy survives restart

- **WHEN** services restart after an administrator saves policy or filtering state
- **THEN** all participating services SHALL continue using the saved SQL authority

#### Scenario: Keycloak directory remains authoritative

- **WHEN** admission is used with `user_directory: keycloak` or `local`
- **THEN** the directory SHALL retain profile/provisioning authority and verified human observations SHALL supply Fred admission evidence

### Requirement: Admission sources are independent of resource permissions

When filtering is active, the system SHALL admit a non-suspended person if their verified claim evaluation permits admission under the current allow/block mode, they have a current individual exception, or they are a current member of an authorized team, including a Free team. Ordinary public-team visibility SHALL not count as membership. Admission SHALL neither grant a platform role nor extend team or resource permissions. Account suspension and required CGU acceptance SHALL still apply.

#### Scenario: New non-matching person is refused

- **WHEN** a new person is not admitted by the current rule mode and has no individual exception or eligible membership
- **THEN** normal platform access SHALL return HTTP 403 with `detail="platform_access_denied"`

#### Scenario: One source is removed while another remains

- **WHEN** a person's individual exception is removed but another valid admission source remains
- **THEN** admission SHALL remain available through that other source

#### Scenario: Visibility and admission are different

- **WHEN** a person can view a public authorized team but is not its member
- **THEN** that visibility SHALL not grant platform admission

#### Scenario: Admitted person is suspended or lacks resource permission

- **WHEN** an otherwise eligible person is suspended or requests a resource they cannot access
- **THEN** the existing suspension or resource refusal SHALL remain effective

### Requirement: Admission is enforced at backend boundaries

The same authoritative live policy and exception state SHALL govern normal direct and delegated human requests across participating backends and replicas. A workload acting for a person SHALL use that person's complete, unconflicted and unexpired selected human evidence interpreted under the current policy mode, or independent exceptions, never the workload's claims or service role. Pure service operations SHALL retain existing authentication and authorization. JWT decoding caches SHALL NOT cache admission decisions or prevent selection of a newly configured claim for direct human requests. Only active-policy selected human evidence SHALL be persisted; whole JWTs and unrelated claim values SHALL NOT be persisted or exposed in principal responses/logs. Shared-state failures SHALL fail closed with HTTP 503 rather than be presented as definitive policy denial.

#### Scenario: Direct API or cached token cannot bypass removal

- **WHEN** a person's last exception is removed and they call another backend or replica with an already decoded JWT
- **THEN** the next request SHALL use current admission state and be refused

#### Scenario: Policy changes with a cached human token

- **WHEN** an administrator changes a selected claim, predicate, allow/block mode or all/any combination
- **THEN** subsequent direct human requests SHALL evaluate the new policy against verified token facts without restart or token renewal

#### Scenario: Delegated person loses admission

- **WHEN** a person's last admission source is withdrawn
- **THEN** delegated calls SHALL be refused even if the workload remains authorized as a service

#### Scenario: Claim-derived delegated eligibility is stale

- **WHEN** selected evidence is expired, contradictory or incompatible with the current selected paths
- **THEN** it SHALL NOT establish claim-derived eligibility

#### Scenario: A newly selected delegated claim has no observation

- **WHEN** a changed rule references a claim not present in the person's stored verified evidence
- **THEN** rule-derived admission SHALL be refused until fresh human evidence covers all selected paths, in both allow and block modes, while independent exceptions remain effective

#### Scenario: Admission authority unavailable

- **WHEN** authoritative policy, exceptions or required membership cannot be read reliably
- **THEN** normal human platform requests SHALL fail closed with HTTP 503
