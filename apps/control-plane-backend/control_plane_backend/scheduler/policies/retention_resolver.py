"""Per-team retention resolver (CTRLP-12 B3).

Resolves, for a single retention field, the effective value a team gets given
the platform cap and the team's own override — under the RFC §3.B rule
**platform caps, team may only tighten**.

The clamp (:func:`resolve_team_retention`) is a *pure* function: no I/O, no
store access. It only compares two ISO-8601 duration strings (via
``duration_to_seconds``) and returns one of the *original* strings — never a
duration recomputed back to ISO — so the smallest input representation is
preserved exactly.

The thin wrapper (:func:`resolve_team_retention_view`) applies the clamp to both
governed fields (``team_delete_grace`` and ``max_idle``) using
``evaluate_purge_policy`` for the caps. It stays pure too: the caller (B4/B5)
does the store read and passes the override strings in.

    Edge case — **``platform_max`` is None** (the catalog configured no cap for

    *loosen* retention — the opposite of "platform caps, team may only tighten"
    (RFC §3.B). The field falls back to unset (``effective=None``,
