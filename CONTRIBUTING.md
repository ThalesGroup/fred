### Roles

- **Internal Maintainers** (Thales):
  - Drive architecture and major design decisions
  - Maintain CI/CD and security processes
  - Review and merge contributions from all sources

- **External Contributors**:
  - Submit issues, bug reports, and suggestions
  - Propose improvements and fixes via GitHub pull requests
  - Collaborate via discussions and code reviews

### Communication

- Internal team coordination is handled via Thales tools (email, GitLab).
- External collaboration happens via **GitHub issues and pull requests**.

## üîÑ Repository Structure

This project uses two synchronized repositories:

- **Internal GitLab** (for Thales developers):
  [gitlab.thalesdigital.io/tsn/innovation/projects/fred-oss](https://gitlab.thalesdigital.io/tsn/innovation/projects/fred-oss)

- **Public GitHub** (for open source contributions):
  [github.com/ThalesGroup/fred](https://github.com/ThalesGroup/fred)

### Synchronization Policy

## üßæ License

All contributions must be compatible with the project‚Äôs open source license (see `LICENSE` file in the repo).

## üéØ Coding Style

- Follow the existing formatting and structure.
- Write **clear, consistent, and maintainable** code.
- Prefer readability and clarity over cleverness.
- We recommend using tools such as `prettier` in Javascript or `black` in Python to format your code.
- Please respect the conventions in effect for the following languages : PEP8 in Python and ECMAScript in Javascript

### Code formatting

#### Frontend

For the frontend part we use the [prettier](https://prettier.io/) code formatter.

With the [prettier vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and by adding this to your `.vscode/settings.json` your code will format automaticaly on every file save:
```json
{
    "[typescriptreact]": {
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "[typescript]": {
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    },
    "[json]": {
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    }
}
```

You can also run it from the terminal to format all the frontend files in one command:
```sh
cd frontend
make format
```

---

## üß™ Testing

Testing is mandatory for any non-trivial change. Both unit and integration tests are run using `pytest`.

### Recommended workflow:

```bash
make build     # create virtual environment via Poetry
make run       # start the app locally
make test      # run all tests (unit + integration)
```

Ensure tests pass **before** opening a pull request.

---

## üêõ Issues Management

- Use **plain English** when reporting issues or requesting features.
- Apply only the **default GitHub labels** (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`) ‚Äî do not create custom labels.
- Include:
  - Clear and concise problem description
  - Steps to reproduce (if a bug)
  - Motivation and expected behavior (if a feature)

### Clean Commit History

If your branch has a messy or noisy commit history (e.g. "fix typo", "oops", "test again", etc.), we encourage you to squash your commits before merging.

Squashing helps keep the main branch history clean, readable, and easier to debug.

Tip: Use git rebase -i or select "Squash and merge" when merging the PR.
