    Controller responsible for listing synthetic or discovered metadata entries from pull sources.

    Pull sources are configured locations (e.g., folders, repositories, URLs) from which documents
    can be discovered but not necessarily uploaded yet. These entries represent candidate documents
    for ingestion.

    Endpoints:
    ----------
    - `GET /documents/pull`: returns a paginated list of `DocumentMetadata` entries, combining known ingested
      documents and synthetic placeholders for discovered but unprocessed files.

    Notes:
    ------
    - If a file has been previously ingested, its metadata will be returned.
    - If a file has been discovered but not ingested, a placeholder metadata is returned.
    - This endpoint does not modify any data or trigger ingestion.
