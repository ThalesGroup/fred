# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# BaseCatalogStore defines a portable interface for cataloging pull-mode documents
# across different storage backends (e.g., DuckDB today, ClickHouse later).
#
# The catalog itself serves multiple essential purposes:
#
# 1. Performance: Avoids expensive directory scans or remote listings (e.g., S3, WebDAV)
#    every time the UI or backend wants to explore pull-mode sources.
#
# 2. Filtering/Search: Enables fast querying of metadata like filename, extension,
#    size, and modification date â€” even across thousands of files.
#
# 3. Consistency: Allows Temporal workflows or agents to use a consistent view of
#    available files without reloading them dynamically.
#
# 4. Portability: Supports flexible migration to scalable backends later by keeping
#    a clean and backend-agnostic interface.
#
# 5. Caching/Snapshots: Useful for incremental processing, change detection, and
#    eventually correlating catalog entries with ingestion status.
#
# In short: the catalog is a lightweight, queryable index of pull-source files.
