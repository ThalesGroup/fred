Base KPI Store Abstraction
==========================

This module defines the *storage contract* for Fred’s KPI system.

Why this exists in Fred:
- We want **one emission API** (KPIWriter) that can plug into **many backends**
  (OpenSearch, Prometheus/Remote Write, ClickHouse, CSV for tests, etc.).
- Backends differ in capabilities, so we keep the store interface minimal but
  sufficient: readiness, single-event ingest, bulk ingest, and a *best-effort*
  query API for dashboards/health checks.

Key ideas:
- `BaseKPIStore` is a `Protocol` (static duck-typing) → implementations don’t
  need inheritance, only matching shape.
- `LogKPIStore` is the dev/default sink: never fails, logs what would happen.
  Useful for local runs and unit tests where metrics persistence is out of scope.

class BaseKPIStore(Protocol):
    """Abstract KPI store API used by `KPIWriter`.

    Architectural role:
    - Decouple **metric emission** from **physical storage**.
    - Keep the contract intentionally small so backends remain easy to implement.
    - Allow services to boot even if the store is slow to initialize
      (writer calls `ensure_ready()` but does not crash the app on failure).

    Implementation notes:
    - Implementers should be idempotent and fast for `index_event`.
    - `bulk_index` is for throughput (batching) when the caller can coalesce.
    - `query` is intentionally generic (best-effort); some backends may
      implement only a subset of filtering/aggregation.

        Why:
        - We prefer to *self-provision* indices/mappings on first run to reduce ops toil.
        - Called once at startup by `KPIWriter`; failures should be non-fatal upstream.
