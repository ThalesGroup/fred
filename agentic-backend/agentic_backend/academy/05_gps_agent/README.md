# 05 – GPS Agent

This step introduces agents that manipulate **geographic coordinates** directly.

## What it shows

- How to capture and validate latitude / longitude in the agent state.
- How to perform simple proximity / distance reasoning.
- How to emit geo‑oriented outputs that the Fred UI can display or forward to tools.

## Files

- `gps_agent.py` (or similarly named) – see this folder for the concrete implementation.

Use this as a starting point when you want agents that reason about locations without yet calling external map APIs.
