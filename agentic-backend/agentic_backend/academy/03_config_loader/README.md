# 03 – Asset Responder

This step shows how an agent can **work with uploaded assets/files** in the Fred ecosystem.

## What it shows

- Where to plug asset upload / retrieval logic into an `AgentFlow`.
- How to pass asset information through the graph state.
- How to combine asset context and LLM reasoning in the final answer.

## Files

- `config_loader.py` – example agent using assets (see code for exact behavior).

Use this as a starting point when you want agents that react to files (reports, PDFs, datasets, etc.) provided by the user.
