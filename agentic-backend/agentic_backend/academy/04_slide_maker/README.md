# 04 – Slide Maker

This step focuses on generating a **structured slide deck** (outline) from a natural‑language request.

## What it shows

- Turning a free‑form prompt into sections / slides / bullet points.
- Using LangGraph nodes to separate:
  - intent understanding,
  - outline generation,
  - and final Markdown formatting.
- Producing Markdown that can be rendered as slides or pasted into presentation tools.

## Files

- `slide_maker.py` – the agent that turns a topic into a slide outline.

Use this as a blueprint for agents that transform user questions into structured documents.
